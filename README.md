# A Simple Neural Network
a neural network built with Numpy   
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lichuanro/simple-neural-network/master/img/0.png)   
architecture of the model is as above    
algorithm and formula is based on [UFLDL Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/supervised/MultiLayerNeuralNetworks/)   

## The model   
validation loss is too high and the hyperparameter should be adjusted, the prediction is not as good as expected currently

## Environment   
just python 3.5 or higher with numpy
